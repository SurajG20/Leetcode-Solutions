* we are given a data stream of non inegative integers
* summary ranges initiate the object with empty stream
* add num to it
* then we call get intervals it will return the ranges
* we add a single element like [ 4,4]
* another item like [7,7]
* when there is no common item, we add like [4,4],[7,7]
